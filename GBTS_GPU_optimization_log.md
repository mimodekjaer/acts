# GBTS GPU optimization log

Branch: `feat/gbts-traccc-determinism`. Hardware: NVIDIA H100 NVL, CUDA 13.1,
build `cuda-fp32` preset (`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=75`, PTX JIT on the H100).
Data: `/shared/traccc/data/ttbar_mu200`, ITk geometry, GBTS config in
`/shared/traccc/GBTS`.

Measurement protocol for every entry:
- Throughput: `traccc_throughput_mt_cuda ... --processed-events=500
  --reco-stage=seeding-only` (only the GBTS seeding is timed; clusterization
  and spacepoint formation are pre-computed), run twice; the two seed totals
  ("Reconstructed track parameters") must be identical (determinism check).
- Latency: `ncu --metrics gpu__time_duration.sum -k regex:"gbts|cub"` over 3
  events; per-kernel time summed per event.

Constraint: the physics cuts and the produced seeds must not change (bit-level
differences caused by reordering float arithmetic are documented per entry).

## Baseline (commit 26f710ead)
- seeding-only: 1.030 ms/event (970 ev/s), 1 953 000 seeds, deterministic.
- GPU busy per event ~813 us, GPU idle ~315 us (nsys): idle is host-side:
  gaps before memsets (27/event, 94 us), before D2H readbacks/waits (77 us),
  before H2D uploads from pageable memory (10/event, 36 us).
- Top kernels (us/event): make_graph_edges fill 162 + count 113, CCA 15x7.4
  = 112, match 76, bin_spacepoints 53, rebid 5x10.5 = 52, reset 5x8.4 = 42,
  node radix sort ~80, fill_path_store 20, compress 17.
- ncu: make_graph_edges and match are instruction bound (issue active
  70-78%, SM throughput 42-71%); bin_spacepoints (issue 4%, 0.8 waves,
  single-address atomic cursor) and CCA (issue 11%, 0.4 waves) are latency /
  launch bound.

## Entries

### 1. Pinned static tables + memset elimination (FASTER, small)
Result: 1.030 -> 1.010 ms/event, seeds identical.
- Static tables copied per event from pageable std::vectors -> pinned
  vecmem::vector members (async copies no longer stall the host thread).
- 10 of 16 explicit per-event memsets removed by letting kernels initialise
  what they own (kept flags in the fill pass, neighbour counts in match,
  CCA levels in compress, seed proposals/ambiguity in fill_path_store, edge
  bids in count_terminus, next-round bids in reset_edge_bids via a double
  buffer).
Remaining memsets: eta_node_counter, num_incoming_edges, hit_bids, counters.

Baseline numbers (commit 26f710ead, rebuilt): seeding-only throughput
**1.06 ms/event** (943 ev/s), GBTS GPU kernel time 844 us/event, GPU idle
inside the seeding ~320 us/event (11 host syncs, ~60 launches/memsets/copies).
Kernel ranking (us/event): make_graph_edges fill 162, count 112, CCA 15x7.4 =
111, node radix sort (8 one-sweep passes of 64-bit keys) 112, match 76,
bin_spacepoints 54, rebid 5x10.5 = 52, reset_edge_bids 5x8.4 = 42,
fill_path_store 20, compress 18, convert 14, fit 9, ...

### 1. Drop debug-only device counters and an unneeded memset  -> 1.016 ms/event (-4%)
- `nConnections` (match kernel) and `nTerminusEdges` (count_terminus) were
  same-address global atomics feeding only DEBUG log lines / a redundant
  zero check; removed together with the counters D2H copies.
- The `neighbours` buffer memset was unnecessary (only the first
  `num_neighbours[e]` entries of a row are ever read).
Effect: -2 contended atomics per edge/terminus, -1 memset, -2 D2H copies.
Determinism: identical seed totals (1 953 000 / 500 events).
